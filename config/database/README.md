# Database dumps

This folder contains DB dumps generated by `db.sh`

The `db.sh` script requires either the command `dump` or `restore`, and optionally a file name.
When no file name is provided, the default is used, which is `"memgpt"` (resulting in the file "memgpt.sql")

## Export DB

```shell
# Default file:
./db.sh dump

# Export to custom file:
./db.sh dump initial-state
```

## Import DB

```shell
# Default file:
./db.sh restore

# Import custom file:
./db.sh restore initial-state
```
